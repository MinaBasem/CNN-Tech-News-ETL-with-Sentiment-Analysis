      "Hundreds of OpenAI staffers are calling for the resignation of the ChatGPT company’s board, and threatening to quit themselves, after a tumultuous weekend that began with the surprise ouster of CEO Sam Altman and ended with Altman being hired by Microsoft.\\\n",
      "In a letter obtained by CNN, the more than 500 employees accused the OpenAI board of mishandling Altman’s firing, failing to provide sufficient evidence for claims that Altman had not been candid with the board, and “negotiating in bad faith” with the company’s executive leadership.\\\n",
      "“Your actions have made it obvious that you are incapable of overseeing OpenAI,” wrote the employees. “We are unable to work for or with people that lack competence, judgement and care for our mission and employees.”\\\n",
      "The employees also warned that they would “imminently” follow Altman to Microsoft unless the board resigns and reinstates Altman and Greg Brockman, the former OpenAI president who was also removed by the board on Friday.\\\n",
      "Among the signatories is Mira Murati, who as recently as Friday had been named by the board as Altman’s interim successor, as well as Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI’s co-founder, chief scientist and board member who had been widely reported as having played a role in Altman’s dismissal. Murati’s promotion has since been superseded by the appointment of incoming interim CEO Emmett Shear, the 40-year-old co-founder of the livestreaming company Twitch.\\\n",
      "On Monday, as news of the letter emerged, Sutskever\\xa0', posted, '\\xa0an apology on X that acknowledged his contribution to the leadership crisis, which appeared to revolve around tensions between Altman and the board about the pace and scope of AI development.\\\n",

      "The Elon-Musk owned social media platform, X, confidently claims that it harnesses industry-leading brand safety tools to ensure a positive experience for advertisers on the platform — but a quick glance at where advertisements for prominent brands actually appear tells an entirely different story.\\\n",
      "Over the last 24 hours, a Reliable Sources review found advertisements for a cohort of major companies and organizations have appeared directly on the verified profile account of VDARE, an openly racist, white supremacist outlet that publishes some of the most vile content on the internet.\\\n",
      "Those companies and organizations include Amazon, Samsung, the Denver Broncos, Cox Communications, STARZ, The Wall Street Journal, The Michael J. Fox Foundation, the University of Missouri, New York Waterway, Axios, Puck, Ad Age, Morning Brew, and the Asian Development Bank.\\\n",
      "The fact that X permits a publication like VDARE to operate a verified account on the platform — giving it access to monetization and boosting its visibility to users — is in itself seriously concerning (Facebook and YouTube, for instance, ', have banned the outlet, ' from their platforms). But that it apparently also believes it is appropriate to monetize the outlet’s vicious hate speech says volumes not only about the company’s ethics, but its supposed commitment to brand safety.\\\n",
      "X must be well aware that it is pairing advertisements with racist content, given that the NFL made noise about this very problem last week. The league ', expressed concern, ' its ads were being displayed on accounts featuring racist material, including VDARE’s, following ', a report, ' from the progressive watchdog Media Matters, which brought the issue to attention. \\\n",
      "And yet, X has taken little if any discernible action to remedy the problem. Instead, it has continued to place advertisements for some of the world’s most recognizable companies directly on the account of one of the most notorious white supremacist outlets on the web.\\\n",
      "All the while, Linda Yaccarino, the former NBCUniversal advertising boss turned X executive, has claimed publicly and privately that X has taken incredible measures to ensure advertisers don’t find their brands adjacent to hate speech on the website. But those claims don’t seem to hold much water, given the ugly reality of what is transpiring on X.\\\n",
      "In a Thursday night statement, X effectively acknowledged it has more work to do to make the platform safe for brands. \\\n",
      "“X cares about the health and safety of the platform for all its users, advertisers and publishers, and we’re accelerating products so our content partners can be removed from some in-app placements like profile and search,” a company spokesperson told CNN.\\\n",
      "The statement from X — rare these days — was likely a sign of how things are going behind the scenes. Some of the brands whose advertisements appeared on VDARE’s account expressed strong displeasure on Thursday when they became aware of the situation.\\\n",
      "“Racist hate speech is completely antithetical to everything the STARZ brand stands for and we have suspended all advertising on X immediately and indefinitely,” a STARZ spokesperson told me Thursday evening.\\\n",
      "A spokesperson for the New York Waterway told me that it found the news “disturbing” and that the company had “no knowledge” of the matter and would “definitely be contacting” X about it. The representative added that New York Waterway “wants nothing to do with hate speech, and we do not want our ads near any organization or entity that promotes it.”\\\n",
      "Jon Kelly, co-founder and editor-in-chief of Puck, said that it was “obviously appalling and completely antithetical” to the company’s values to advertise on VDARE’s profile. Kelly said the outlet has since “enacted various measures to hopefully ensure this was the first and last time that this happens.”\\\n",
      "The University of Missouri said it does not “condone organizations that promote intolerance.” Cox Communications said it was investigating the matter. And a spokesperson for the NFL pointed to its previous statement expressing concern that its advertisements were appearing on the accounts belonging to racists.\\\n",
      "Spokespeople for The Wall Street Journal, Axios, Morning Brew, Ad Age, The Michael J. Fox Foundation, and the Asian Development Bank either declined or did not respond to requests for comment.\\\n",
      "That said, it is, frankly, astonishing that big companies continue to believe that the current iteration of X is a friendly corner of the web to advertise their carefully manicured brands on, when they should know full well by now that it is a chaotic platform, rife with content moderation problems.\\\n",
      "As Lou Paskalis, a seasoned advertising executive, said on Thursday, “Having ads run against racist and antisemitic content is the proverbial third rail for major advertisers who have enterprise-wide initiates to support diversity, to support inclusion, that are not only important to their brands but their employees and shareholders.”\\\n",
      "“A single incident of this, screen shot and circulated, undoes years of hard work,” Paskalis added. “And no amount of advertising benefit would ever displace the potential risk of one incident where your ad shows up next to unsavory content.”\\\n",

      "Nonprofit\\xa0online watchdog the Center for Countering Digital Hate on Thursday hit back at Elon Musk’s X in a motion to dismiss the\\xa0', social media company’s August lawsuit, '.\\\n",
      "X Corp., the parent company of the platform formerly known as Twitter, accused the Center for\\xa0Countering Digital Hate\\xa0of deliberately trying to drive\\xa0away X’s\\xa0advertisers by publishing reports critical of the platform’s response to hateful content. X’s lawsuit specifically claims that CCDH violated Twitter’s terms of service, and federal hacking laws, by scraping data from the company’s platform and by encouraging an unnamed individual to improperly collect information about Twitter that it had provided to a third-party brand monitoring provider.\\\n",
      "CCDH claims that X’s lawsuit is “riddled with legal deficiencies” and attempts\\xa0to punish the nonprofit for its First Amendment protected speech, according to its Thursday filing\\xa0in the Northern\\xa0District Court of\\xa0California.\\\n",
      "“At its core, X Corp.’s grievance is not that the CCDH Defendants gathered public data in violation of obscure (and largely imagined) contract terms, but that they criticized X Corp. (forcefully) to the public,” the filing states.\\\n",
      "X and a lawyer representing the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on CCDH’s Thursday filing.\\\n",
      "After Musk acquired the social media platform just over a year ago, CCDH —\\xa0', in addition to other researchers, '\\xa0and\\xa0', online safety groups, '\\xa0— released a series of reports criticizing the company’s handling of hate speech, including evidence, for example, that\\xa0', anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric had jumped, '\\xa0under Musk’s leadership and that',  the platform was monetizing, '\\xa0some previously banned\\xa0but\\xa0then',  , 'reinstated accounts that were spreading hateful content.\\\n",
      "In a blog post from X after filing its lawsuit, the company\\xa0', said, '\\xa0the suit was intended to promote free expression and that it “rejects all claims made by the CCDH.”\\\n",
      "Musk has blamed CCDH and other watchdog groups for X’s decline in advertising revenue. The billionaire\\xa0', in September, '\\xa0accused the Anti-Defamation League of being the reason that the company’s ad revenue remained down 60%, despite efforts by X to promote new\\xa0', brand safety controls, '\\xa0for advertisers.\\xa0In its complaint against CCDH, X alleges it\\xa0has lost\\xa0“at least tens of millions of dollars” in advertising revenue.\\\n",
      "However,\\xa0after Musk’s takeover,\\xa0', some advertisers raised concerns, ' about mass layoffs that affected their contacts within the company or general uncertainty about the platform’s future;\\xa0', other brands have paused spending, '\\xa0after their ', ads ran alongside hateful content, '.',  , 'The\\xa0X owner himself has also been a controversial flashpoint on the platform — last month, in a post that was later deleted,\\xa0', Musk encouraged users, '\\xa0to keep up with the Israel-Hamas war by following an account known for spreading misinformation. Just this week, Musk\\xa0', agreed with an antisemitic post on X, ', endorsing the claim that Jewish communities push “hatred against Whites.”\\\n",
      "CCDH CEO Imran Ahmed told CNN that the group’s response to\\xa0X’s lawsuit is meant to “show that we aren’t cowed by this.”\\\n",
      "“Ironically, he doesn’t\\xa0want a free marketplace of ideas about what he claims is his free marketplace of ideas,”\\xa0Ahmed said. “CCDH’s research held up a mirror to Elon Musk’s increasingly toxic and ugly platform, and rather than doing the right thing and tackle\\xa0the hate and lies which are disfiguring X, Mr. Musk chose instead to sue the mirror,”\\xa0he added.\\\n",
      "In addition to its motion to dismiss, CCDH’s filing also includes a motion to strike most of X’s claims under California’s “anti-SLAPP” law, which could require X to prove it is likely to succeed in its claim before the case can move forward and could allow for expedited dismissal if X’s lawsuit is found to be related to CCDH’s\\xa0protected speech.\\\n",
      "Among the allegations in X Corp.’s complaint, the company accuses CCDH of breach of contract for allegedly violating the platform’s Terms of Service by “scraping X to obtain data” for a report. CCDH said in its motion to dismiss that the group, in fact, used the platform’s “own search function to collect publicly available information.”\\xa0CCDH in its filing also notes that despite X’s allegations that the group’s research has cost the platform ad dollars, the company “has not asserted a defamation claim.”\\\n",
      "“Understandably so, since it cannot allege that the CCDH Defendants said anything knowingly false, nor does it wish to invite discovery on the truth about the content on its platform,” the group’s Thursday filing states. “Instead, X Corp. has ginned up baseless claims purporting to take issue with how the CCDH Defendants gathered data that formed the basis for their research.”\\\n",

      "The technology behind viral AI chatbot ChatGPT just got a whole lot smarter.\\\n",
      "During its first developer conference held in San Francisco on Monday, OpenAI unveiled a series of artificial intelligence',  , 'tool updates, including the ability for developers to create custom versions of ChatGPT. It is also launching a digital store and cutting base prices for developers while also pledging to pay some who use OpenAI products on their platforms.\\\n",
      "The event comes nearly a year after the launch of ChatGPT, which helped renew an arms race among tech companies to develop and deploy similar AI tools in their products. CEO Sam Altman said 2 million developers now use the platform, and',  , 'about 90% of Fortune 500 companies are using the tools internally', . , 'It',  , 'currently has 100 million active users.\\\n",
      "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, an early partner of OpenAI, joined Altman on stage to discuss how',  , 'his company continues to infuse GPT technology into its suite of 365 tools. “It’s so different and new,” he said. “I’ve been in the infrastructure business for three decades – and never seen anything like this.”\\\n",
      "Among the biggest changes announced is the introduction of GPTs, or customized versions of ChatGPT. Similar to plugins, GPT can connect to databases, be',  , 'used in emails or facilitate e-commerce orders, the company said. On its website, it says',  , 'GPTs could be used to help with math tutoring, train for a marathon or design stickers, without any prior coding experience. Users can try it out via ', chatgpt.com/create, '.\\\n",
      "“Creating one is as easy as starting a conversation, giving it instructions and extra knowledge, and picking what it can do, like searching the web, making images or analyzing data,” the company said in a ', blog post, '.\\\n",
      "OpenAI is also rolling out a GPT Store, starting later this month, to allow GPTs to become searchable. Similar to other app stores, they’ll be listed on a leaderboard, and the company will highlight useful tools across categories such as productivity, education and “just for fun.” The company said developers will also be able to earn money based on how many people are using their GPT.\\\n",
      "Altman also showed off GPT-4 Turbo, the latest version of the technology that powers ChatGPT. He said it now can support input that’s equal to about 300 pages of a standard book, about 16 times longer than the previous iteration.\\\n",
      "The platform will also have expanded knowledge through April 2023 “and continue to improve over time,” Altman said. “We are just as annoyed as all of you, probably more, that GPT’s knowledge of the world ended in 2021,” he added.\\\n",
      "The company also said it is cutting the price for developers, to $0.01 for 1,000 input tokens, which is about three times cheaper than GPT-4. This would allow developers to save on overall costs when running high volumes of information through its systems.\\\n",
      "Other improvements to the software include more modalities, such as enhanced text-to-speech with a more natural sounding audio with six preset voices to choose from.\\\n",
      "Altman said OpenAI is also doubling down on safety and privacy, noting chats with the tools are not shared with builders.\\\n",
      "The company also introduced Copyright Shield, which will allow OpenAI to step in and defend customers –- and pay costs incurred –- if copyright infringement becomes an issue. Rivals such as Google and Adobe have taken ', a similar approach, '.\\\n",
      "“The price and performance improvements, model customization and legal indemnification will have more immediate impact as these capabilities have been sought by developers for awhile now,” said Arun Chandrasekaran, an analyst at Gartner Research. “The autonomous agents will take more time to create an impact but are bold steps ahead for the future of Generative AI.”\\\n",
      "In the meantime, OpenAI emphasized the latest announcements are only part of what’s still ahead.\\\n",
      "“GPTs will continue to get more useful and smarter, and you’ll eventually be able to let them take on real tasks in the real world,” the company said in the blog post. “We think it’s important to move incrementally towards this future, as it will require careful technical and safety work—and time for society to adapt. We have been thinking deeply about the societal implications and will have more analysis to share soon.”\\\n",

      "In a letter obtained by CNN, the more than 500 employees accused the OpenAI board of mishandling Altman’s firing, failing to provide sufficient evidence for claims that Altman had not been candid with the board, and “negotiating in bad faith” with the company’s executive leadership.\\\n",

      "A “groundswell” of advertising executives have urged X\\xa0chief executive\\xa0Linda Yaccarino to resign from\\xa0her role at the embattled social media company in the wake of an ', advertiser exodus and scrutiny, ' over owner Elon Musk’s ', antisemitic remarks, ' on the platform, according to\\xa0marketing industry veteran Lou Paskalis.\\\n",
      "“I sent her a text yesterday after thinking about it long and hard saying that,” Paskalis,\\xa0the founder and chief executive of marketing consultancy AJL Advisory,\\xa0told CNN\\xa0on\\xa0Monday, adding that other members of the industry had done the same. “My advice was to leave before her reputation was damaged.”\\\n",
      "Yaccarino, a former NBCUniversal executive, joined the company formerly known as Twitter earlier this year\\xa0to help revive its advertising business. Hundreds of major brands ', paused their ad spend, ' after Musk’s acquisition over concerns about content moderation and the platform’s future under the eccentric billionaire.\\\n",
      "But at least\\xa0a half dozen\\xa0major advertisers, including\\xa0media giants\\xa0Disney, Paramount and NBCUniversal, halted their spending on X on Friday.\\xa0IBM ', also suspended advertising, ' on the platform after its ad appeared alongside pro-Nazi content.\\xa0The decisions to drop the platform\\xa0followed criticism of Musk over his public embrace of an antisemitic conspiracy theory favored by White supremacists.\\\n",
      "“She thinks quitting is failing … She believes that she can mother Elon Musk into someone who could be respected by the advertising community, and that ship has definitely sailed,” Paskalis said. “But she’s not going to come off the mechanical bull without all of us telling her, ‘It’s time to go.’ And I believe that there has been a groundswell of a lot of people such as myself saying, ‘save yourself.’”\\\n",
      "Yaccarino has indicated that, for now, she’s not going anywhere.\\\n",
      "“I believe deeply in our vision, our team, and our community,”\\xa0she ', posted, ' Monday morning\\xa0on the platform. “I’m also deeply committed to the truth and there is no other team on earth working as hard as the teams at X.”\\\n",
      "In a letter to employees sent Sunday night, which was viewed by CNN, Yaccarino also reaffirmed her commitment to the company’s work.\\\n",
      "“Our work is critical, but it’s not always easy,” she said. “What we’re doing matters, which means it naturally invites criticism from those who do not share our beliefs.”\\\n",
      "Yaccarino has also said that X has taken steps to “combat antisemitism and discrimination,” as she told employees in the Sunday letter. The company over the weekend accused Media Matters — the progressive media watchdog that first reported that ads for IBM and other major brands were running alongside pro-Nazi content — of aggressively searching for such content in a way that “misrepresented the real user experience” and could “mislead advertisers.” (Media Matters has pushed back on this assertion.)\\\n",

      "The long-standing battle over the iOS’ blue and Android’s green text bubbles will soon take a',  , 'more friendly turn.\\\n",
      "Apple announced on Thursday plans to adopt a messaging standard that will finally bring iMessage features to Android users, eroding what some considered an element of Apple’s walled garden.\\\n",
      "The change – first reported by tech site ', 9to5Mac, ' – will add features, such as read receipt, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms.\\\n",
      "Apple told CNN in a statement it will add support for the standard, called RCS (Rich Communication Services), later next year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data.\\\n",
      "“We believe RCS Universal Profile will offer a better interoperability experience when compared to SMS or MMS,” the company said in the statement. “This will work alongside iMessage, which will continue to be the best and most secure messaging experience for Apple users.”\\\n",
      "The change follows pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union’s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. Earlier this year, it ', launched an investigation, ' into whether it considers iMessage a core product.\\\n",
      "Meanwhile, Google, which already has support for RCS within its messaging app, has been vocal about wanting Apple to adopt the standard. In early November, ', the company wrote a letter to the European Commission, ' arguing iMessage was indeed a core Apple product and should be required to comply.\\\n",
      "“Everyone deserves to communicate with each other in ways that are modern and secure, no matter what phone they have,” Google said in a statement. “That’s why we have worked closely with the mobile industry to accelerate the adoption of RCS, and we’re happy to see Apple take their first step today by coming on board to embrace RCS. We welcome Apple’s participation in our ongoing work with GSMA to evolve RCS and make messaging more equitable and secure, and look forward to working with them to implement this on iOS in a way that works well for everyone.”\\\n",
      "Over the years, Apple has pushed back on this type of connectivity. When asked how Steve Jobs would feel about the state of communication across platforms, CEO Tim Cook said last year during a conference: “I don’t hear our users asking that we put a lot of energy in on that at this point.” When an audience member said he wasn’t able to share certain videos with his mother, who was not an iPhone user, Cook responded: “Buy your mom an iPhone.”\\\n",
      "The change also comes nearly two months after Apple announced its next-generation iPhone 15 would tout a USB-C universal charging system for the first time. The switch came less than a year after the European Union voted to approve legislation to require smartphones, tablets, digital cameras, portable speakers and other small devices to support USB-C charging by 2024.\\\n",
      "“Both the adoption of the USB-C for the new iPhones as well as the support for RCS messaging is Apple’s way of getting ahead of European Union regulations which would likely have forced its hand in any case,” said Dipanjan Chatterjee, a VP principal analyst at Forrester Research. “Better the company own it and market it to their advantage.”\\\n",
      "According to Michael Inouye, a principal analyst at ABI Research, Apple is also expected to work with the GSM Association, a nonprofit that works with mobile operators, to make RCS more secure through encryption and bring it closer to if not on par with iMessage –- “something that could benefit all users.”\\\n",
      "“Some have also questioned if this will open the door for more Apple users to try new Android devices now that communications will be better supported across iOS and Android, such as foldable phones,” Inouye said. “But I don’t foresee this playing a significant role in changing demand for iPhones.”\\\n",
      "The move, however, doesn’t necessarily mean the green bubbles (Android or other users) and blue bubbles (Apple users) that are displayed when messaging someone on the other platform will go away anytime soon.\\\n",
      "Chatterjee said that keeping the colors is an Apple marketing strategy that will likely continue, despite the shift to the RCS standard.\\\n",
      "“The blue bubble is a badge of the Apple tribe, and this distinctive identity, as well as the company’s iMessage platform, is not going anywhere anytime soon,” Chatterjee said. “Instead, RCS support will enable a smoother and better customer experience of iPhone users communicating across platforms. The company hopes that’s a win-win for all –- their customers get to inhabit Apple’s world, but also play nicely with others.”\\\n",

      "Brockman’s post, which appeared to be a joint statement speaking for himself and Altman, said the two were “still\\xa0trying to figure out exactly what happened,” but summarized the sequence of events that led to Altman’s firing.\\\n",
      "On Thursday evening, Altman received a text message from Ilya Sutskever, another co-founder of OpenAI and its chief scientist, Brockman said. The text message asked Altman to attend a meeting the following day.\\\n",
      "“Sam joined a Google Meet and the whole board, except Greg, was there,” Brockman said, referring to himself. “Ilya told Sam he was being fired and that the news was going out very soon.”\\\n",
      "“At 12:19pm, Greg got a text from Ilya asking for a quick call,” Brockman continued. “At 12:23pm, Ilya sent a Google Meet link. Greg was told that he was being removed from the board (but was vital to the company and would retain his role) and that Sam had been fired. Around the same time, OpenAI published a blog post.”\\\n",
      "['\\n', According to Swisher, ', Altman did not learn about the subject of the meeting until 30 minutes before.\\\n",
      "After receiving word of his own ouster as board chair, Brockman\\xa0', subsequently announced , 'he was quitting the company.\\\n",
      "Driving the board’s decision were Sutskever’s concerns, which appear to have been exacerbated by OpenAI’s recent developer conference and the\\xa0', announcement , 'of a way for anyone to create their own versions of ChatGPT,\\xa0', said Swisher, ', citing her sources. Swisher\\xa0', added, '\\xa0that it represented “an inflection moment of Altman pushing too far, too fast” for Sutskever, who “got the board on his side.”\\\n",
      "In its announcement of Altman’s firing, OpenAI claimed that Altman had been insufficiently “candid” with the board and that it had hindered the board’s ability to carry out its responsibilities.\\\n",
      "The suddenness of the decision was reflected in how some of OpenAI’s most important partners were left in the dark.\\\n",
      "Microsoft, which has invested billions into OpenAI and integrated its technology into the Bing search engine, was not informed of Altman’s firing until “just before” the public announcement,\\xa0', Swisher said, ', while employees were not given any advance warning.\\\n",
      "On Friday evening, Altman posted on X that he “loved working with such talented people” at OpenAI and that he “will have more to say about what’s next later.”\\\n",
      "He\\xa0', added , 'that “if I start going off, the openai board should go after me for the full value of my shares.”\\\n",
      "In his post, Brockman hinted that he and Altman may already be forging ahead. “Please don’t spend any time being concerned. We will be fine,” Brockman said. “Greater things coming soon.”\\\n",
      "CNN has reached out to OpenAI for comment on Brockman and Swisher’s accounts of how the events transpired.\\\n",
      "In announcing Altman’s firing, OpenAI said chief technology officer Mira Murati will serve as interim CEO.\\\n",
      "In a statement on its website, OpenAI said Murati is “exceptionally qualified” and that the company has “the utmost confidence in her ability to lead OpenAI during this transition period.”\\\n",
      "Murati, 34, has been part of OpenAI’s leadership team for five years, according to the company. The statement said she will step in as the board “conducts a formal search for a permanent CEO.”\\\n",
      "The move immediately catapults Murati – already a significant figure in AI – as one of the most high-profile and recognizable women in tech.\\\n",
      "And it puts her atop the company as questions swirl about what Altman’s ouster means, the direction of the board and even the purpose of the company and artificial intelligence itself.\\\n",
      "But in some ways, this is familiar ground for Murati, a Dartmouth-educated engineer. In July, when OpenAI’s head of trust and safety announced plans to step down, Murati took up the baton as interim manager of that team.\\\n",
      "Murati has previously spoken before about her high hopes for AI. In 2022, for example, she told CNN that AI “is really an extension of the human mind, and I hope we figure out how to deploy it in ways that are robustly beneficial and effective.”\\\n",

      "An exhausted CNN is breathing a sigh of cathartic relief. \\\n",
      "After enduring unprecedented internal strife that generated an unrelenting storm of negative press coverage over the past year, staffers at one of the world’s most iconic news outlets are hoping to move on and put a tumultuous chapter behind them.\\\n",
      "CNN staffers don’t want the organization to be known for and consumed by a never-ending soap opera starring the C-suite. They want the world to read about the news that its journalists break. They want the news to be the star.\\\n",
      "With Chris Licht’s ', dismissal, ' as chairman and chief executive of CNN on Wednesday morning, staffers are aiming to get back to that mission. They are deeply yearning for it.\\\n",
      "Licht’s brief 13-month tenure as network boss was stained by a series of severe missteps that ultimately made it impossible for him to lead the company. Not all of the tumult that occurred over the past year was his fault, to be sure. The poor advertising climate and business realities of a mega-merger made some cost-cutting necessary. And taking the reins from previous network boss Jeff Zucker, who was revered by staff, was never going to be easy. \\\n",
      "But a number of self-inflicted wounds kept Licht, and thus CNN, in the press for all the wrong reasons. Employees never fully trusted Licht’s leadership skills, business chops, or editorial vision — a disastrous cocktail that certainly contributed to why there were so many damaging leaks to the press.\\\n",
      "In recent months, David Zaslav, chief executive of CNN parent Warner Bros. Discovery, also started to have serious concerns. That was evidenced by Zaslav’s move last week to install his top lieutenant, David Leavy, as chief operating officer of CNN. \\\n",
      "But an already bad situation took a turn for the worse when The Atlantic’s Tim Alberta published his devastating 15,000-word profile on Licht. It was the death knell. The piece, in which Alberta spoke to more than 100 CNN employees, called into question Licht’s ability to lead the organization moving forward.\\\n",
      "The damning magazine story crystalized Zaslav’s concerns, a person familiar with the matter said. The WBD chief over the weekend started seriously considering relieving Licht of his duties. The final decision to remove Licht was made earlier this week. And, on an early morning stroll through a smoke-filled and apocalyptic Central Park on Wednesday, Zaslav informed Licht that his time was up.\\\n",
      "CNN’s 4,000+ employee base — including anchors — learned of the seismic shakeup soon after, during the network’s editorial meeting, which takes place daily at 9am. Zaslav walked into the Hudson Yards conference room in which New York staffers gather and informed employees there and around the world that Licht was out. Licht, notably, was not present for the meeting and never sent a final memo or goodbye to the staff he once led.\\\n",
      "Zaslav, who took responsibility for the chaos that has gripped CNN in recent months, said that Licht’s job was “never going to be easy.” He praised his “amazing career” and wished him well on his future endeavors. “For a number of reasons, things didn’t work out and that’s unfortunate,” Zaslav said. “It’s really unfortunate. And ultimately that’s on me. And I take full responsibility for that.”\\\n",
      "Zaslav told CNN employees that the company is “in the process of conducting a wide search,” both internally and externally, for a new network chief. Despite the fact that the search is already underway, Zaslav cautioned that it will “take a while” to identify a new network head.\\\n",
      "In the interim, Zaslav said the leadership team will be comprised of three veteran network executives: Amy Entelis, executive vice president of talent and content development; Virginia Moseley, executive vice president of editorial; and Eric Sherling, executive vice president of U.S. programming. Leavy will continue overseeing the company’s commercial activities.\\\n",
      "“We have great confidence in this group and will fully support them until a new CEO is named,” Zaslav said in an emailed statement to CNN staff. “We are in good hands, allowing us to take the time we need to run a thoughtful and thorough search for a new leader.”\\\n",
      "Many staffers also have great confidence in the group, comprised of experienced hands who have already demonstrated their ability to lead the organization through turbulent waters. But that is not to say that the anxiety among the rank-and-file has totally dissipated.\\\n",
      "While staffers might have breathed a sigh of relief upon learning of Licht’s dismissal, there is still significant apprehension in the air about what comes next. Will there be more cost cutting? Will decisions made by Licht be undone? Will the next network chief be an improvement over Licht? Or will employees come to regret his dismissal?\\\n",
      "And perhaps, most pressing after Alberta’s profile hinted at corporate meddling: Will WBD ensure CNN can operate, from an editorial standpoint, independent of the parent company?\\\n",
      "Those are very real questions that are floating around the halls of CNN right now. And the answer to each of them remains to be seen.\\\n",

It is also launching a digital store and cutting base prices for developers while also pledging to pay some who use OpenAI products on their platforms.\\\\The event comes nearly a year after the launch of ChatGPT, which helped renew an arms race among tech companies to develop and deploy similar AI tools in their products. CEO Sam Altman said 2 million developers now use the platform, and',  , 'about 90% of Fortune 500 companies are using the tools internally', . , 'It',  , 'currently has 100 million active users.\\\\Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, an early partner of OpenAI, joined Altman on stage to discuss how',  , 'his company continues to infuse GPT technology into its suite of 365 tools. “It’s so different and new,” he said. “I’ve been in the infrastructure business for three decades – and never seen anything like this.”\\\\Among the biggest changes announced is the introduction of GPTs, or customized versions of ChatGPT. Similar to plugins, GPT can connect to databases, be',  , 'used in emails or facilitate e-commerce orders, the company said.

Similar to other app stores, they’ll be listed on a leaderboard, and the company will highlight useful tools across categories such as productivity, education and “just for fun.” The company said developers will also be able to earn money based on how many people are using their GPT.\\\\Altman also showed off GPT-4 Turbo, the latest version of the technology that powers ChatGPT. He said it now can support input that’s equal to about 300 pages of a standard book, about 16 times longer than the previous iteration.\\\\The platform will also have expanded knowledge through April 2023 “and continue to improve over time,” Altman said. “We are just as annoyed as all of you, probably more, that GPT’s knowledge of the world ended in 2021,” he added.\\\\The company also said it is cutting the price for developers, to $0.01 for 1,000 input tokens, which is about three times cheaper than GPT-4. This would allow developers to save on overall costs when running high volumes of information through its systems.\\\\Other improvements to the software include more modalities, such as enhanced text-to-speech with a more natural sounding audio with six preset voices to choose from.\\\\Altman said OpenAI is also doubling down on safety and privacy, noting chats with the tools are not shared with builders.\\\\The company also introduced Copyright Shield, which will allow OpenAI to step in and defend customers –- and pay costs incurred –- if copyright infringement becomes an issue. Rivals such as Google and Adobe have taken ', a similar approach, '.\\\\“The price and performance improvements, model customization and legal indemnification will have more immediate impact as these capabilities have been sought by developers for awhile now,” said Arun Chandrasekaran, an analyst at Gartner Research. “The autonomous agents will take more time to create an impact but are bold steps ahead for the future of Generative AI.”\\\\In the meantime, OpenAI emphasized the latest announcements are only part of what’s still ahead.\\\\“GPTs will continue to get more useful and smarter, and you’ll eventually be able to let them take on real tasks in the real world,” the company said in the blog post. “We think it’s important to move incrementally towards this future, as it will require careful technical and safety work—and time for society to adapt.

The company over the weekend accused Media Matters — the progressive media watchdog that first reported that ads for IBM and other major brands were running alongside pro-Nazi content — of aggressively searching for such content in a way that “misrepresented the real user experience” and could “mislead advertisers.” (Media Matters has pushed back on this assertion.)\\\\However, X did not remove the pro-Nazi accounts mentioned in Media Matters’ report, instead saying that their posts had little engagement and that they would no longer be eligible for monetization.\\\\“No critic will ever deter us from our mission to protect free speech,” Yaccarino said in the Sunday letter.\\\\\", \"The long-standing battle over the iOS’ blue and Android’s green text bubbles will soon take a',  , 'more friendly turn.\\\\Apple announced on Thursday plans to adopt a messaging standard that will finally bring iMessage features to Android users, eroding what some considered an element of Apple’s walled garden.\\\\The change – first reported by tech site ', 9to5Mac, ' – will add features, such as read receipt, typing indicators, better support for group chats and higher quality media sharing of images and videos, across platforms.\\\\Apple told CNN in a statement it will add support for the standard, called RCS (Rich Communication Services), later next year. RCS is considered the replacement to alternatives such as SMS, or short messaging service, and can work over both Wi-Fi and mobile data.\\\\“We believe RCS Universal Profile will offer a better interoperability experience when compared to SMS or MMS,” the company said in the statement. “This will work alongside iMessage, which will continue to be the best and most secure messaging experience for Apple users.”\\\\The change follows pressure from both regulators and competitors to more seamlessly work across operating systems. The European Union’s Digital Markets Act, for example, requires companies to make their key services interoperable between platforms. Earlier this year, it ', launched an investigation, ' into whether it considers iMessage a core product.\\\\Meanwhile, Google, which already has support for RCS within its messaging app, has been vocal about wanting Apple to adopt the standard. In early November, ', the company wrote a letter to the European Commission, ' arguing iMessage was indeed a core Apple product and should be required to comply.\\\\“Everyone deserves to communicate with each other in ways that are modern and secure, no matter what phone they have,” Google said in a statement. “That’s why we have worked closely with the mobile industry to accelerate the adoption of RCS, and we’re happy to see Apple take their first step today by coming on board to embrace RCS. We welcome Apple’s participation in our ongoing work with GSMA to evolve RCS and make messaging more equitable and secure, and look forward to working with them to implement this on iOS in a way that works well for everyone.”\\\\Over the years, Apple has pushed back on this type of connectivity. When asked how Steve Jobs would feel about the state of communication across platforms, CEO Tim Cook said last year during a conference: “I don’t hear our users asking that we put a lot of energy in on that at this point.” When an audience member said he wasn’t able to share certain videos with his mother, who was not an iPhone user, Cook responded: “Buy your mom an iPhone.”\\\\The change also comes nearly two months after Apple announced its next-generation iPhone 15 would tout a USB-C universal charging system for the first time. The switch came less than a year after the European Union voted to approve legislation to require smartphones, tablets, digital cameras, portable speakers and other small devices to support USB-C charging by 2024.\\\\“Both the adoption of the USB-C for the new iPhones as well as the support for RCS messaging is Apple’s way of getting ahead of European Union regulations which would likely have forced its hand in any case,” said Dipanjan Chatterjee, a VP principal analyst at Forrester Research. “Better the company own it and market it to their advantage.”\\\\According to Michael Inouye, a principal analyst at ABI Research, Apple is also expected to work with the GSM Association, a nonprofit that works with mobile operators, to make RCS more secure through encryption and bring it closer to if not on par with iMessage –- “something that could benefit all users.”\\\\“Some have also questioned if this will open the door for more Apple users to try new Android devices now that communications will be better supported across iOS and Android, such as foldable phones,” Inouye said. “But I don’t foresee this playing a significant role in changing demand for iPhones.”\\\\The move, however, doesn’t necessarily mean the green bubbles (Android or other users) and blue bubbles (Apple users) that are displayed when messaging someone on the other platform will go away anytime soon.\\\\Chatterjee said that keeping the colors is an Apple marketing strategy that will likely continue, despite the shift to the RCS standard.\\\\“The blue bubble is a badge of the Apple tribe, and this distinctive identity, as well as the company’s iMessage platform, is not going anywhere anytime soon,” Chatterjee said. “Instead, RCS support will enable a smoother and better customer experience of iPhone users communicating across platforms.

Employees never fully trusted Licht’s leadership skills, business chops, or editorial vision — a disastrous cocktail that certainly contributed to why there were so many damaging leaks to the press.\\\\In recent months, David Zaslav, chief executive of CNN parent Warner Bros. Discovery, also started to have serious concerns. That was evidenced by Zaslav’s move last week to install his top lieutenant, David Leavy, as chief operating officer of CNN. \\\\But an already bad situation took a turn for the worse when The Atlantic’s Tim Alberta published his devastating 15,000-word profile on Licht. It was the death knell. The piece, in which Alberta spoke to more than 100 CNN employees, called into question Licht’s ability to lead the organization moving forward.\\\\The damning magazine story crystalized Zaslav’s concerns, a person familiar with the matter said. The WBD chief over the weekend started seriously considering relieving Licht of his duties. The final decision to remove Licht was made earlier this week. And, on an early morning stroll through a smoke-filled and apocalyptic Central Park on Wednesday, Zaslav informed Licht that his time was up.\\\\CNN’s 4,000+ employee base — including anchors — learned of the seismic shakeup soon after, during the network’s editorial meeting, which takes place daily at 9am. Zaslav walked into the Hudson Yards conference room in which New York staffers gather and informed employees there and around the world that Licht was out. Licht, notably, was not present for the meeting and never sent a final memo or goodbye to the staff he once led.\\\\Zaslav, who took responsibility for the chaos that has gripped CNN in recent months, said that Licht’s job was “never going to be easy.” He praised his “amazing career” and wished him well on his future endeavors. “For a number of reasons, things didn’t work out and that’s unfortunate,” Zaslav said. “It’s really unfortunate. And ultimately that’s on me. And I take full responsibility for that.”\\\\Zaslav told CNN employees that the company is “in the process of conducting a wide search,” both internally and externally, for a new network chief. Despite the fact that the search is already underway, Zaslav cautioned that it will “take a while” to identify a new network head.\\\\In the interim, Zaslav said the leadership team will be comprised of three veteran network executives: Amy Entelis, executive vice president of talent and content development; Virginia Moseley, executive vice president of editorial; and Eric Sherling, executive vice president of U.S. programming. Leavy will continue overseeing the company’s commercial activities.\\\\“We have great confidence in this group and will fully support them until a new CEO is named,” Zaslav said in an emailed statement to CNN staff. “We are in good hands, allowing us to take the time we need to run a thoughtful and thorough search for a new leader.”\\\\Many staffers also have great confidence in the group, comprised of experienced hands who have already demonstrated their ability to lead the organization through turbulent waters. But that is not to say that the anxiety among the rank-and-file has totally dissipated.\\\\While staffers might have breathed a sigh of relief upon learning of Licht’s dismissal, there is still significant apprehension in the air about what comes next. Will there be more cost cutting? Will decisions made by Licht be undone? Will the next network chief be an improvement over Licht? Or will employees come to regret his dismissal?\\\\And perhaps, most pressing after Alberta’s profile hinted at corporate meddling: Will WBD ensure CNN can operate, from an editorial standpoint, independent of the parent company?\\\\Those are very real questions that are floating around the halls of CNN right now. And the answer to each of them remains to be seen.\\\\\"]\n"
